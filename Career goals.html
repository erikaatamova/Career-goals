<p>Career Goals For This Year</p>
<p style="color:red">For this year, I would like to complete the QA analyst program and be able to build a resume that will help me find the job for me.</p>
<p style="color:blue">The goal, as of right now, is to be able to find a job shortly after summer. I don't have a preference of where exactly, I just want to start somewhere, especially being new to the field.</p>
<p style="color:green"> I hope to be successful in this field and eventually have the chance to move up and get certified in other programs, such as automation. </p>
